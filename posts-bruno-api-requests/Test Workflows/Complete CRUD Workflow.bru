  # Complete CRUD Workflow Test
  
  This is the first step of a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) workflow test.
  
  **Workflow Steps:**
  1. **Health Check** (this request) - Verify API is running
  2. Get all posts (should be empty initially)
  3. Create a new post (requires valid JWT token)
  4. Get the created post by ID
  5. Update the post
  6. Get all posts (should contain our post)
  7. Get posts by author
  8. Delete the post
  9. Verify post is deleted
  
  **Prerequisites:**
  - Posts API running on the configured port
  - Valid JWT token from Users API (update the token in protected requests)
  - Database connection working
  
  **Instructions:**
  1. Replace `your-jwt-token-here` in protected requests with a valid JWT token
  2. Run requests in sequence
  3. Update post IDs in subsequent requests based on creation response

tests {
  test("API should be healthy", function() {
    expect(res.getStatus()).to.equal(200);
    expect(res.getBody()).to.have.property('status', 'healthy');
  });
}
